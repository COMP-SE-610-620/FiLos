# FiLOs â€“ Finnish LLM OnSite
## Description
This repository contains the SE.610 and SE.620 students' project work for Solita. The application shows how LLM models can be used onsite with Fi language. The application can understand spoken Finnish language and answer simple questions, leveraging training from KELA open dataset(KELA FAQs).

The system is divided into a backend and frontend. Both applications will be deployed as Docker containers and should be independent of each other.
